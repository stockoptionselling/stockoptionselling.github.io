		 	<p style="margin-left:2em">
		 		My strategy is fairly simple.  I begin by looking for symbols that if I get stuck owning shares of the symbol, I'm not overly concerned.
		 		Once I have created a list of symbols, I determine the purchase price target of each symbol based on various criteria, such as P/E, dividend yield, price history, etc.
		 		<!--To see my current list of symbols and price targets, click <a href="https://www.stockoptionselling.com/priceTargets.xhtml?userRef=S628DVNIOG" target="_blank">here</a>. -->
	 		</p>
	 		<p style="margin-left:2em">
	 			Once I have my symbol list and price targets established, I review PUT option prices on strikes that are at or below my price targets that expire in the next 1 - 8 weeks for each symbol.
	 			<!--To see a list of possible PUT contracts that meet various sets of criteria, click <a href="https://www.stockoptionselling.com/putDashboard.xhtml" target="_blank">here</a>.-->
	 		</p>
	 		<p style="margin-left:2em">
	 			There are two possible outcomes when selling a PUT contract:
	 		</p>
	 		<ol style="margin-left:2em">
	 			<li>The price of the underlying symbol stays ABOVE your contract's strike and the contract expires worthless resulting in NOT having to purchase 100 shares of the underlying at your strike price per share.</li>
	 			<li>The price of the underlying symbol drops BELOW your contract's strike and the contract is assigned, resulting in having to purchase 100 shares of the underlying at your strike price per share.</li>
 			</ol>
 			<p style="margin-left:2em">
	 			The first case is the preferred outcome because you are allowed to repeat the process again while still keeping your full investment as well as the premium collected from the sale of the put contract. 
	 		</p>
	 		<p style="margin-left:2em">
	 			The second case is less ideal because now you own shares of stock that are below your purchase price and the price of those shares could continue to drop.  This is why it is important to sell PUT contracts
	 			ONLY on quality companies (symbols) at a good price.  I like companies that have a good dividend history and dividend yield because that usually helps prevent the stock from dropping too far.  Worst case you hold the stock and collect the dividends.
	 			One thing to remember is that when you own shares of stock, you immediately lose money for every penny the stock drops.  However, when you sell a PUT option contract, the stock has to first drop to your strike price before you start losing money.
	 			As a result, if I get assigned a PUT contract, I am aggressive and look to sell a CALL contract at the same strike I bought the stock and hopefully get the shares called away from me as soon as possible to prevent it from having a chance to move further against me.
				Furthermore, look to sell a call IMMEDIATELY to collect some premium to help reduce further downside risk. Once I am able to get the shares called away via a CALL option, I can go back to selling a PUT contract.  You will notice this is a circular process and is commonly called "The Wheel Strategy".

		 	<p style="margin-left:2em">
		 		After learning the basics of put and call options, most people realize the input of one is the output of the other. 
		 		As a result, the two option types can be used together in a simple continuous cycle, referred to as "The Wheel".

	 			discussing this strategy.
	 		</p>
	 		
	 		<p style="margin-left:2em">
	 			This is a great strategy because it is simple and forces the successful investment principle of buying low (selling a put) 
	 			and selling high (selling a call).

				<h4 style="margin-left:2em;color:#0B6EFD">General Rules</h4>	
			 <ol style="margin-left:2em">
		 			<li>
		 				When selling put option contracts:
		 				<ul>
		 					<li>
		 						All puts should be cashed secured puts, which are puts where the option seller has enough money to buy the 
		 						100 shares if the contract is used/exercised.
		 					</li>
		 					<li>
		 						The best time to sell puts are on days when the stock price is down.
		 					</li>
		 				</ul>
		 			</li>	
		  			<li>
		  				When selling a call option contacts:
		  				<ul>
		 					<li>
		 						All calls should be covered calls, which are calls where the option seller owns 100 shares.
		 					</li>
		 					<li>
		 						The best time to sell calls are on days when the stock price is up.
		 					</li>
		 				</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Don't be greedy. Making a little money is better than losing money.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Try to close option contracts early for a fraction of the profit after earning a 
								majority of the profits.
							</li>
							<li>
								Close out earnings trades ASAP because there have been many instances where winning trades 
								have quickly changed to losing trades.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Don't be too risky. Try to keep your portfolio in cash and cash secured puts, as this is the least risky of all option strategies.
						<ul>
							<li>
								When getting assigned stock from selling a put, don't wait to review call options waiting for the price to go up 
								because the price may go down more.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Only sell cash secured puts on stocks/etfs that meet ALL of the following criteria:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The stock/etf has options that are liquid/popular. Usually this is the case if it has options that expire weekly. 
								<!--See our symbol ranking page for options 
								<a href="../rank.xhtml" target="_blank">here</a>.-->
							</li>
							<li>
								The stock/etf is something that you wouldn't mind owning 
								(because the stock may make an unexpected big move and you will be assigned sometimes even at a strike price that seemed impossible to reach).
							</li>
							<li>
								The strike price is at a "good price".
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Look to sell contracts with more than 30 and less than 55 days remaining until expiration for optimal time decay.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Contracts that don't expire for more than 7 days should NOT include an earnings event. 
								Either wait until after earnings or select the expiration date before earnings.
								<!--See our page that lists upcoming earnings for popular/common symbols 
								<a href="../earnings.xhtml" target="_blank">here</a>.-->
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						For earnings trades, sell puts in the later afternoon prior to the earnings announcement.
						<ul>
							<li>
								When getting filled, consider immediately setting up a good til cancelled (GTC) closing order 
								for $0.01 to get out of the trade when the market opens the following day.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						If you have increments of 100 shares, never execute a sell order.  Instead, sell a call option aggressively
						<ul>
							<li>
								Adding the premium collected to the strike price gives the actual sell value, which is likely always higher than selling outright (even if its deep in the money).
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
